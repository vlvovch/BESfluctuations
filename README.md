# Proton number cumulants from hydro (2107.00163)

This repository contains tabulated data for proton number cumulants published in paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00163)
which is a hydrodynamics-based non-critical baseline.

The full baseline corresponds to data labeled “baryonconservation_and_excludedvolume”.
The folders contain more differential data including rapidity cut dependence (in our notation dY = 2*y_cut), as well as proton and antiproton cumulants in addition to net-protons.
